### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

I started with Mobile Firstand I used Grid on both containers because the content is stacked, I also used Span for styling purposes. On the Summary I used flex and I spaced contents around.
I also learned more about Grids like Grid Area

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  grid-area: 2/2;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge about Grid and Flexbox and also improve my naming conventions. And also learn the basics of JavaScript so that I can use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content.
